# Chutes and Ladders Game
This code is an implementation of the classic "Ladders and Chutes" Game. It simulates 2-4 players and generates proper outputs.

* there can be 2 to 4 players.
* the spinner dimensions could be between 1 to 6.

## Getting started
* You simply can run the game with default values by running the main class. 
* This assignment also could be delivered as an independent library or an executable jar instead(but I'm delivering that as per requested in the requirements).

### Note
There is also a GameServices class defined that can be used for reading parameters from input console.

##### writing unit tests is an important TODO for the whole project.
